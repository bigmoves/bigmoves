### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chad. I'm currently working on the next generation of budgeting and reporting software at [OpenGov](https://opengov.com/). I live in Bishop, CA and spend my free time rock climbing, skiing, and exploring the outdoors. I also enjoy tinkering with new javascipt libraries and frameworks. 

Here are some projects I've worked on recently...

### [WIP] Personal Website 
My personal [site](https://rad-sigma.vercel.app/) is built with [Remix.run](https://remix.run/), [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com), and [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). Photos are from adventures with friends and how I like spending time away from screens.

### Melt
I recently built a [website](https://github.com/bigmoves/melt) for a friend to showcase her cermanics. The site hasn't gone live yet but it uses Next.js and [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/) as the backend API. Airtable is surprisingly good as a CMS. It's easy to manage content and upload photos. It also has event triggers which I use for the contact page to send emails so she is notified when someone wants to connect ðŸ˜‰.

### No Luck Run
A few years ago I built a [website](https://github.com/bigmoves/noluckrun) for a friend's neighborhood fun run. They needed a way for folks to sign-up for the event and accept payments/donations. The site is built with Next.js, Chakra UI, Firebase, Mapbox and Stripe. We succussfully used the site to get everyone registered for the event and accept payments, though it was postponed due to the pandemic.
